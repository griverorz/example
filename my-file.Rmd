# Data analysis

This is a very important document in which we analyze the totally,
completely unknown _iris_ dataset which contains three plant species
(setosa, virginica, versicolor) and four features measured for each
sample.

```{r}
library(nnet)
data(iris)
head(iris)
```

We study different models to classify the species using petal and
sepal information. For instance, the very best, unbeatable model is
the multinomial logistic regression:

```{r}
mod <- lm(as.numeric(Species) ~ ., data=iris)
mod
```

which works very well as can be seen in the confusion matrix:

```{r}
table(iris$Species, cut(predict(mod), c(0, 1, 2, 3)))
```

Isn't it awesome?
